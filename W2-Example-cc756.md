<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Mention the Vendors you explored and some pros/cons for each that affected your decision</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I explored Google and Amazon as I had experience with them both briefly.<br>They both offer very nice quick start options and have a free tier<br>to choose from however the free tier for Amazon was much more clear<br>on the agreement to overages where as with Google it was much harder<br>to tell off the bat what I could and could not do.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Which vendor option did you go with and why?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Amazon AWS since I had slightly more experience with them and they had<br>clear options for what I could do.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> How do you plan to manage your usage quota? (Also mention the quota)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The 750 hour quota will be managed by turning off the machine once<br>I am done with it.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What issues did you face and how did you resolve them?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had issues only with the branches portion of this exercise. I had<br>troubles pushing at first and it turned out be a command flag in<br>a config file so that was easily resolved with the help of the<br>professor. Unfortunately I am still plagued by the issue of a unrelated history<br>so I had issue with my pull requests on the GitHub platform. I<br>am working to find solutions but maybe I will delete those branches and<br>start a fresh one from scratch with a fresh fork.<br></p><br></td></tr>
